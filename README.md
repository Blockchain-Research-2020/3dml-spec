# 3dml-spec
3DML is designed for streaming and rendering massive 3D geospatial content such as terrain surfaces, 3D city models, individual models and BIM/CAD. 3DML is based on the open source SQLite database with optional SpatiaLite support and defines a database schema that contains a hierarchical data structure of the models, associated feature information and project information tables. The 3DML database specification, associated block formats, and the associated feature information are open formats that are not dependent on any vendor-specific solution, technology, or products. The 3DML database can be used as a local resource for 3D models or as an online database serving remote clients.
